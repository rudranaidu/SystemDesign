Databases
Relational DB: Store user profiles and job postings.
NoSQL DB: Use a document store (e.g., MongoDB) for user preferences and job recommendations.
Search Engine: Use Elasticsearch for full-text search and filtering.

Relational DB (PostgreSQL/MySQL): Store the core, consistent, structured data like user profiles and job postings.
NoSQL (MongoDB/DynamoDB): Use for caching or serving precomputed recommendations and denormalized job posting data for fast reads.

Recommendation Models
The Recommendation Engine uses a combination of Collaborative Filtering, Content-Based Filtering, and optionally, Hybrid Models.

Content-Based Filtering
  Matches users with jobs based on similarity between user features and job features.
  Uses cosine similarity or other distance metrics to compare vectors.
  Example:
  User skills: ["Python", "Machine Learning", "Data Analysis"].
  Job skills: ["Python", "Deep Learning", "Data Science"].
  Similarity score is computed based on vector overlap.

Collaborative Filtering
  Leverages patterns of user behavior to recommend jobs.
  Two main approaches:
  User-based Filtering: Finds similar users (based on interaction matrix) and recommends jobs they interacted with.
  Item-based Filtering: Finds similar jobs (based on interactions) and recommends those to the user.
  
  Example:
  User A and User B both applied for jobs X and Y. If User A applies for job Z, recommend Z to User B.

Matrix Factorization
  Uses techniques like Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) or Alternating Least Squares (ALS) to decompose the user-job interaction matrix into latent features.
  Captures hidden patterns (e.g., jobs liked by "data science" professionals) and recommends accordingly.
  
  Deep Learning Models
  Use Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF) or Autoencoders for more personalized and complex recommendations.
  Embedding layers represent users and jobs in a dense vector space for better matching.

Ranking and Filtering

  Once potential jobs are identified, the system ranks them based on relevance and user preferences:
  
  Relevance Scoring:
  Combines the similarity scores from Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering.
  Business Logic:
  Incorporate rules (e.g., prioritize recent postings or local jobs).

Retrieving Top k Jobs

Implementation:
Maintain a priority queue or max heap of size k. For each job, calculate the similarity and insert it into the queue.
If the queue exceeds k, remove the job with the lowest similarity score.

Optimization:
Use precomputed similarity scores from batch processing.
Leverage MapReduce for parallel computation if dataset is large.

Batch Processing
  The engine periodically runs batch jobs to precompute recommendations:
  
  Extract relevant features and update user-job matrices.
  Train or update recommendation models using new interaction data.
  Store the results in a NoSQL database for fast retrieval.
