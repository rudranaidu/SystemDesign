High-level overview covers many essential use cases for a Notification System,
but a few additional considerations could be included to enhance the design. 
Let's break it down and review the functional and non-functional requirements.

Functional Requirements:
  Email Messages: ✅
  
  Supports email notifications for different use cases like order updates, marketing, etc.
  SMS Messages: ✅
  
  Ensures timely delivery for urgent notifications like OTPs, account alerts.
  Push Notifications: ✅
  
  Important for mobile users, delivering app-specific updates.
  Users Can OPT-IN and OPT-OUT from Notifications: ✅
  
  This is critical for compliance with privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CAN-SPAM), and should include user preference management.
  Retry Mechanism for Offline Users: ✅
  
  Important for ensuring delivery to users who may not be reachable initially. Consider implementing exponential 
  backoff in retries to avoid overwhelming the system or recipients.
  
  No Duplicate Messages: ✅  
  Ensures a clean and user-friendly experience by preventing multiple notifications for the same event.

  Message Priority Delivery: ✅
  
  Useful for separating time-sensitive messages (e.g., OTPs) from lower-priority ones (e.g., promotions). 
  You might want to use different queues or priority-based processing for this.

  Rate Limiting Capabilities: ✅

  Helps prevent overloading users with notifications and ensures compliance with third-party service limitations 
  (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid).

Additional Functional Requirements to Consider:
Message Scheduling:

You may want to add a scheduling feature for non-urgent notifications (e.g., sending promotional emails at a particular time).
Multi-Language Support:

If the system serves users in different regions, consider adding the ability to send notifications in different languages.
Audit and Reporting:

Track delivery success, failures, and user interactions with notifications (e.g., email opens, SMS clicks). This is useful for analytics and debugging.


Non-Functional Requirements:
Scalability for Millions of Messages: ✅

Ensure the system can horizontally scale, especially the message producers and Kafka brokers, to handle peak loads.
Availability: ✅

Consider deploying your system across multiple regions or availability zones to avoid single points of failure.
Low Latency: ✅

Ensure that priority notifications like OTPs are delivered within seconds. For non-urgent notifications, slightly higher latencies are acceptable.
Fault Tolerance: ✅

Ensure the system can handle failures in individual components (e.g., Kafka, third-party providers) without affecting the overall functionality. 
This could include retries, circuit breakers, and fallback mechanisms.
