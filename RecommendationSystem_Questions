High-Level Design Questions:
What is the core objective of your recommendation engine?
  Are you focusing on improving user engagement, retention, or conversions?

Do you have any specific KPIs or metrics in mind to measure the performance?
What types of recommendations will you prioritize?
For example, will it be based on trending content, personalized suggestions, or a combination of both?


User Behavior and Data Collection:
How do you plan to capture user behavior in your system?
Will you collect explicit feedback like likes, ratings, and comments, or implicit feedback like watch history, time spent on videos, clicks, etc.?
What challenges do you anticipate in collecting and processing implicit feedback from users?
What kind of data will be stored to represent user behavior?

Will you store all actions taken by a user or only specific ones that contribute to recommendation accuracy?

How will you handle data volume as user behavior data can quickly grow in size?

Content-Based and Collaborative Filtering:
You mentioned two primary models: Content-Based Filtering and Collaborative Filtering. When would you prefer one over the other?
In which scenarios will content-based filtering be more effective than collaborative filtering?
How do you plan to handle the cold start problem when collaborative filtering lacks sufficient user data?
How will you extract and represent the features of the content (e.g., movies, videos)?

Will you use metadata like genre, actors, or use techniques like Natural Language Processing (NLP) on descriptions and titles to extract meaningful features?
How will these features be stored and retrieved efficiently?
Personalization & Profile Building:
How would you build user profiles to offer personalized recommendations?

What data will go into the Profile Builder? How frequently will these profiles be updated (e.g., after every action, daily batch update)?
How will you combine both explicit and implicit feedback to build a comprehensive user profile?
How do you envision scaling the profile building process for millions of users?

Will this be done in real time or using batch processing?
What sort of database would you choose to store the user profiles? (e.g., Cassandra, Redis, MongoDB)
Candidate Generation, Filtering, and Ranking:
What is your plan for generating candidate recommendations?

How will you retrieve potential items for recommendation from the Similar Items database and user profile?
Will you use any approximate nearest neighbor search algorithms to improve scalability in candidate generation?
How do you rank the candidates to prioritize the best recommendations?

Are you considering building a ranking model using machine learning?
What features will go into your ranking model? (e.g., user-item interactions, item popularity, time spent watching)
How do you plan to filter irrelevant recommendations?

Will you use some business logic to filter out irrelevant recommendations (e.g., content already watched by the user, low-rated content)?
How will you handle freshness and ensure content recommendations are not stale?
Cold Start Problem & Data Sparsity:
How do you plan to handle the cold start problem for new users or items?

What methods will you use when you have little to no historical data for a user or content?
How would you gradually improve recommendations for a new user?
What strategy will you use to mitigate data sparsity, especially in collaborative filtering?

Are there any techniques like matrix factorization or embedding that you plan to use?
System Design and Scalability:
How do you ensure the system scales as the user base and content library grow?

How will you handle millions of users and millions of items efficiently?
What databases or storage solutions are you considering, and how will they scale with the traffic and data growth?
How do you ensure real-time recommendation with low latency?

Are you planning to precompute recommendations and store them, or will you compute them on the fly?
What caching strategy will you use to reduce response times?
Feedback Loop:
How will you integrate a feedback loop into the system?

How will the system use real-time user behavior (e.g., clicks, watch time) to improve future recommendations?
Will you give more weight to recent behavior than older behavior?
How will you incorporate A/B testing to evaluate and improve recommendation algorithms?

What metrics will you use to determine which recommendation strategy is more effective?
How will you handle user segmentation to run these tests without affecting the overall experience?
Handling Bias and Diversity:
How do you prevent the recommendation engine from showing only a narrow range of content?

How do you ensure that the recommendations include a diverse range of content and avoid reinforcing biases in user preferences?
How will you handle situations where users are stuck in a "filter bubble"?

How will you diversify recommendations to prevent users from only seeing similar content repeatedly?
Architecture and Tech Stack:
Walk me through the tech stack you’d use for implementing this recommendation engine.

How would you handle data ingestion, storage, processing, and serving recommendations?
What technologies will you use for distributed processing (e.g., Apache Kafka for message queues, Spark for distributed computation)?
How do you ensure fault tolerance and high availability of your recommendation system?

What happens if one of your components (e.g., recommendation engine, database) fails?
How would you ensure a distributed, fault-tolerant architecture for high availability?
                                                           
Machine Learning and Algorithms:
What machine learning algorithms do you plan to use for collaborative filtering?
Are you considering matrix factorization (e.g., SVD, ALS) or deep learning approaches (e.g., neural collaborative filtering)?
How will you ensure that your machine learning models are continuously improving?
Will you retrain models on a fixed schedule, or do you plan to use online learning where models adapt in real-time?
How would you collect training data and balance it for better accuracy?
Miscellaneous Considerations:
How would you handle GDPR and user privacy regulations?

How would you anonymize and secure user data while still generating personalized recommendations?
What’s your fallback strategy if the recommendation engine doesn’t have enough data to generate recommendations?

Will you rely on default recommendations (e.g., popular items) or a heuristic approach?
