What would happen if a product runs out of stock while multiple users are placing orders?

When a product runs out of stock while multiple users are placing orders, handling this scenario efficiently is 
crucial to maintain a smooth user experience and avoid overselling. Here's how it can be managed:

Optimistic Locking or Versioning: When a user places an order, the system checks the stock availability. 
With optimistic locking, the stock count is checked right before the transaction is finalized. 
If two users try to buy the last unit simultaneously, only the first transaction that gets processed succeeds, 
while the second one fails. The second user is then informed that the product is out of stock.

Inventory Reservation: Implement a system where stock is temporarily reserved when users add products to their cart.
This reservation has an expiration (e.g., 10-15 minutes), giving users time to complete the purchase. 
If the user doesnâ€™t finish, the reserved stock is released back into the system. 
This reduces the chances of overselling but requires careful balance to avoid blocking stock unnecessarily.

Atomic Transactions: Ensure that the stock update and order placement occur in a single atomic transaction.
This prevents any race conditions where multiple users may reduce the stock simultaneously, leading to negative inventory counts.

Eventual Consistency with Queuing: In high-traffic environments, use a queue system where order requests are processed sequentially. 
This ensures that orders are processed in the order they are received, reducing the chances of overselling in peak times.

Real-time Stock Updates: Continuously update stock availability in real-time, both on the backend and user-facing front end. 
This ensures that users are informed immediately if a product is out of stock when they try to check out, reducing frustration.
