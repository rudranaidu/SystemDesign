Functional requirements:
   1) User Registration and profile creation
   2) Sending emails with attachements 
   3) Set preferences for emails
   4) Search emails
   5) Tagging
   6) Spam and virus detection
   7) contacts and groups
   8) Implementing service registry and proxies -> This is common for all system designs using Microservices architectures

Questions need to ask:
    1) what is the maximum size of an attachement
    2) what is the maximum size of contacts in group
    3) No of users in a day/ how many mails per user?
    4) what is the average size of mail
    

Identify the Microservices:
     1) Profile service
     2) User authentication/Autherization service
     3) EmailService
     4) SearchService
     5) Spamdetection Service
     6) VirusScannerService
     7) ContactMangaementService
     8) PreferencesService
     9) ServiceRegistry

Implement ServiceRegistry:
   We need gateway to receive external requests and route it to correct internal services.
   Whenever a service is switched on it register itself to ServiceRegistry.So the registry maps
   the method to service. We also need to implement functionality to check if otherservices or 
   operational or not.

   Components required:
              Distributed gateway : it blocks malicious IPaddresses, routes external requests, Translate HTTP to other protocols
              ServiceManager : It keeps the registry, maps methods to handlers
              DistributedCache : Since mapping does not change freequently we can store the mapping in cache.
