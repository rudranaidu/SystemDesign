How would you implement real-time notifications for order updates (e.g., "Your order has been shipped")?

To implement real-time notifications for order updates (e.g., "Your order has been shipped") in an eCommerce application, you can use the following approach:

Message Queue and Event-Driven Architecture: Use a message queue (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ) to publish events like "Order Shipped" or "Order Delivered."
When an event occurs (such as an order status change), it triggers a message that can be processed asynchronously, ensuring the system remains scalable and responsive.

WebSockets or Server-Sent Events (SSE): For real-time notifications, use WebSockets or SSE to maintain a persistent connection between the server and client.
This allows the server to push updates (such as order status changes) to the client in real time without requiring the client to poll the server repeatedly.

Push Notifications for Mobile Apps: For mobile apps, integrate push notification services like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) 
for Android and Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) for iOS. When the order status changes, your backend system can send a push notification to the user's device, 
informing them of the update in real-time.

Email and SMS Notifications: Use email or SMS for order updates as fallback methods or as additional communication channels. Integrate with services like SendGrid, 
Twilio, or AWS SNS to send transactional emails or SMS messages when an order status changes.

Notification Management System: Build a notification management system that tracks user preferences (e.g., opting in or out of notifications) 
and delivers the appropriate type of notification (push, email, or SMS). This system should be decoupled from the business logic, allowing flexibility 
in adding new notification channels.
