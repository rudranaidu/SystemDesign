       9. UserRating
Questions need to ask
      1) What is the expected size of users
      2) What are the number of concurrent users
      3) Is the application is Global
      4) Consistency Vs Availability

PricingService
    We maintain RuleEngine to calculate pricing
    Pricing involves different rules. Based on src,destination, peektime, demand etc.Need to calculate the demand ie if more number of  users booking the ride from same src then demand is high
  Demand = no.of users requestingRide/totalNumberofAvailabe   drivers
        
if demand is > threshold then 
    price = price\*1.1;
 
 Surging pricing can be calculated using above forumla
  ETACalculationService
     We will use location based DB's like QuadTree, HilbertCurve
     or  Graph data structure to store locations and their connectivity.
     User A-Star algorithm to calculate ETA.
 RideMatchingService
       Find nearby Driver who is ready to accept a ride. 
       Give Source and Destination
       If the driver is not accepting then increase the search radius.
   Here we need to find proximity of drivers from the customer.
     Query all drivers around the source 
       then find bestETA among all 
         ETAs <= threshold
    then send request to that driver
