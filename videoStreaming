Capacity Estimate:

1) Howmuch video will need to be processed per livestream

Let us assume that resolutions we want to serve are 1080P,720P, 480P,360P
Let us also assume that encoding of these videos is h264

A cricket match lasts for approximately 10 hours.
A 2 hrs HD movie size is 2 GB and hence we assume that cricket match size would be 10GB

Raw video will be broken into segments and each segment will be processed
into multiple resolutions and codecs.

1080P resolution will be about =  10GB
720P footage will be about 10/2 = 5 GB
480P footage will be about 10/4 = 2.5 GB
360p footage will be about 10/8 = 1.25GB

Total 18.75 GB
Let use assume we have 4 codecs
18.75 * 4 = 75 GB


2) Howmuch data will be tranformed from CDN to users in single livestream?

Assume no of users watching match is 10 millions users
Assume that 50% of users having HD videos and 50% users having mobile devices
For 10hrs match we required 10 GB data. On average user watch 50% live stream
Total datatransfer = sum of ( 50%HD Devices + 50% mobile devices) * 50/100
= ( 50/100 * 10^6 * 10GB + 2.5 GB* 50/100*10^6) * 50/100
=   3.125 PB

3) Howmuch time would it take to send data from event to users device?

   For watching cricket match 10 hrs 10 GB data
   ie 3600 seconds -> 10 GB
   1 second -> 3 KB
   
   in 1 second 3KB of data is transferred from CDN to end user device
   Total time =  video uploadTime + Geographial server to CDN + CDN to endDevice
   Assume that 3KB data will be tranferred from Geographical servers to CDN in 150 milli seconds
   and also assume that it takes 150 milli seconds to transfer 3KB data to upload service.
   Total latency = 1 second + 0.3 + 0.3
                = 1.3 seconds
