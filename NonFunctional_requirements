Explain Fault tolerance and Highavailability

we can achieve fault-tolerance and HA  across the system using multinode deployments. Multinode deployments also ensures scalability
we can achieve HA in Database using Replication.

Replication:

Focuses on datasets by replicating data across multiple database instances.
Ensures high availability by providing redundancy; if one database node fails, another replica can take over.
Improves read performance by distributing read requests to read replicas, reducing load on the primary node.


Multi-Node Architecture:

Focuses on the system level, deploying multiple instances of application services to ensure system availability and scalability.
Often relies on stateless architecture for easy scaling, where requests can be routed to any node without requiring session persistence.

Distinction:

Replication is specific to databases or other stateful components, ensuring data availability and durability.
Multi-node architecture applies to the entire system, enabling fault tolerance and load balancing across nodes.
