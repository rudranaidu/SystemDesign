Fourmulas for capacity estimate
Throughput (QPS=> Query per second): No.Of Daily activeusers * No of operations daily by each User / 10^5
                  
Bandwidth: Find each operation size
           Find Read : Write ratio 

Read bandwidth =  No of opertions per second * size * read/read+write
Write bandwidth =  No of opertions per second * size * write/read+write

Storage capacity = since we already know the size of operation per second , we can extrapoloate those values to 1 year
Storage capacity for 5 years = Storage per second * 10^5 * 400 * 5* Replication factor.

Rounded numbers for Quick calculations
   Hours in a day = 25
   Days in year =  300
   3 years = 1000 days
   1 day = 100000 seconds
   1 second = 10^3 milliseconds
              10^6 microseconds
              10^9 nanoseconds
   1 commodity server = 100 TB of disk
                      = 128 GB of RAM
                      = 32 cores * 8 threds = 250 threads
                      = 50k sockets
                      = 4 GB per seconds datatransfer
                      = 300 MB perseconds datatransfer

Power of 2 and power of 10
2^10  = 10^3 = 1 KB =  1 thousand
2^20 =  10^6 = 1 MB =  1 million
2^30 =  10^9 = 1 GB =  1 billion
2^40 = 10^12 = 1 TB =  1 trillion
2^50 = 10^15 = 1 PB =  1 quadrillion
2^60 = 10^18 = 1 EB =  1 quintillion

Howmany bytes should we use for userID variable if we want to accomodate 100 million users in 1 year?
     100 millions = 100* 10^6 = 10^8  it is equivalent to 2^30.
     we need 32 bits are enough to accomodate 100 million users

Howmany bits should we use for tweet_id?
    50 bits gives the ability to count upto 1000 trillions

    so twitter uses 64 bits to accomodate tweet_id


Exercise1:  Consider below numbers. How much data is required to store photo for 6 years?
            500 million daily active users 
            100 million photos uploaded per day
            Average photo size = 200 KB

Solution) First calculate per 1 day
           = 200 KB * 100 millions
           = 2*10^2 * 10^3 * 100 * 10^6
           = 2* 10^2 * 10^3 * 10^2 * 10^6
           = 2 * 10^13
           = 2* 10 * 10^12
           = 20 TB
          For 3 years = 1000 days (approximately)
          For 6 years = 2000 days
          
          Total amount of data  = 2000 * 20 TB
                                = 40 * 1000 TB
                                 = 40 PB
    
Exercise 2: If 500 million users upload 10 photos per day, Howmuch storage do we need to save metadata for 6 years?
Solution:   Photos -> photoID(8 bytes) ,Userid(4 bytes) , timestamp (4 bytes)
            per single user we need 16 bytes (consider 20 for approximation)

           = 500*10*10^6* 20* 2000
           = 5*100*10*10^6*4*10^4
           = 2*10*10^13
           = 2* 10^14
           = 2*100*10^12
           = 200 TB
 
Exercise 3: If our API takes 100 milliseconds to calculate the response and we are getting 100K requests per seconds, Howmany servers are required?
Solution:   1 thread takes 100 milliseconds to serve 1 request
            No of threads in commoditiy server = 250 threads
            1 thread , in 1 second serves 10 requests
            250 threads, in 1 second serves 2500 requests
            1 server serves 2500 requests per second
            if we want to serve 100K requests then how many servers required?
              100k/2500 = 100000/2500 = 1000/25 = 40 servers
           if we allows 100 CPU in every servers we need 40 servers
           But servers function only 50 percent of their capacity. So  we need 80 servers to serve 100K requests .

Exercise 4: howmany number of servers for storing meatadata calculated in exercise 2, and Replication Factor 3.
            
Solution:   For single DB servers it stores 100TB
            For 200 TB we need 2 servers
            DB servers perfrom 90% of their capacity . So we need 3 servers
            If RF is 3 , we need to 9 servers.

Exercise 5: Consider a messaging application with 200 million daily active users. Each user sends an average of 20 messages per day,
            with each message containing text data of 5 KB. How much data is required to store messages for a year?

Solution:  DAU = 200 million
           Per day each user = 20 messages
           each message size = 5 KB

           PerDay = 200*10^6*20*5*10^3
                 = 2*10^2*10^6*10^2*10^3
          	   = 2*10^13
          	   = 2*10*10^12
          	   = 2*10*1TB
          	   = 20 TB we need per day
	   
           1 year ~ 300 * 20TB
                 ~ 6000 TB
          	   ~ 6PB
Exercise 6: If a video streaming platform has 50 million users streaming videos at an average bitrate of 2 Mbps for 4 hours per day, 
           How much storage space is needed to store video content for a month?

         Per day per user = 4* 3600 (seconds) * 2* 10^6/8 (bits per byte)
                = 4* 36 *10^2*2*10^6/8
                = 4* 36*10^8 *2/8
                 = 3*10^9
                  ~ 3 GB

         Per Month per 50 million users = 50*10^6 *30* 3*10^9
			                   = 5*3*3*10^17
			                   = 45* 10^17
			                   = 4 * 10 * 10^17
			                   = 4 * 10^18
			                   ~ 4 Exabytes
               
Exercise 7: A file-sharing service has 100 million users uploading files at an average rate of 1 GB per user per week.
            How much storage space is needed to accommodate file uploads for 6 months?

Solution)    Per 1 month = 4 weeks
                        = 4* 1GB * 100 million users
                        = 4* 10^9 * 100 * 10^6
                        = 4 * 10^17
                         = 4* 100 * 10^15
                         = 400 PB
             Per 6 months = 6* 400 PB
                          = 2400 PB
                           ~2.4 Exabytes (EB)
      

Exercise 8: An e-commerce platform experiences 1 billion product searches per day, with each search query generating 1 KB of 
            search metadata. How much storage space is required to store search metadata for a month?

Solution)    Per day = 1 billion * 1 KB
                    = 10^9 *10^3
                    = 10^12
                    = 1 TB

             Per month = 30 * 1 TB
                       = 30 TB

Exercise 9:  A music streaming service has 150 million users listening to an average of 30 songs per day, 
             with each song lasting 4 minutes and encoded at 320 kbps. How much storage space is required to store 
             music content for a year?

Solution)    Per Day Per User Calculation:
		Total data consumed per song = (4 minutes * 320 kbps) / 8 bits per byte (to convert from bits to bytes)
		Total data consumed per song = (4 * 60 * 320 * 10^3) / 8 bytes
		= 7.2 * 10^6 bytes
		≈ 7 MB.

	     Total data consumed per day per user = 30 songs * 7 MB
		= 210 MB.

	     Per Year Per User Calculation:
		Total data consumed per year per user = 210 MB * 365 days
		≈ 76.65 GB.

	     For All Users Per Year Calculation:
		Total data consumed per year for all users = 76.65 GB * 150 million users
		≈  11,497.5 petabytes (PB)
		≈  11.4975 exabytes (EB).

Exercise 10: An IoT platform collects sensor data from 10 million devices, with each device generating 100 data points per minute,
             and each data point being 100 bytes in size. How much storage space is needed to store sensor data for a week?

Solution)    
Total data generated per hour per device
                           = 60 minutes * 100 data points per minute * 100 bytes per data point / 8 bits per byte
			   = Total data generated per hour per device = 60 * 100 * 100 / 8 kilobytes
			   = 750,000 kilobytes
	                   = 750 MB
Per Day per Device Calculation:
				= 24 hours * 750 MB
				= 18,000 MB
				= 18 GB
Per Week for 10 Million Devices Calculation:
			 = 7 days * 18 GB per day per device * 10 million devices
			 = 7 * 18 * 10 million GB
			 = 1260 million GB
			 = 1260 terabytes (TB)

Howmany number of servers are required?

Exercise 11: A social media platform has 300 million daily active users, with each user making an average of 50 API calls per day. 
             If each API call takes 50 milliseconds to process and each server can handle 500 requests per second, how many application servers are required to handle the user traffic efficiently?
Solution: Requests per Second Calculation:

Each API call takes 50 milliseconds to process, so the platform can handle 
1000/50 = 20
 requests per second.
Number of Servers Calculation:

Total number of requests per day =
