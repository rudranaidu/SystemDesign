Functional Requirements:

User Features:
  User Registration and Login (OAuth, Email-based, Social Sign-in)
  Profile Creation and Management: Users can create profiles, add bio, profile pictures, etc.
  Follow/Unfollow: Users can follow/unfollow other users.
  Post Creation: Users can post text, images, and videos.
  Feed Generation: Users should see a timeline of posts from accounts they follow.
  Like/Comment/Share: Interaction with posts.
  Search: Search for users, posts, hashtags.
  Notifications: Real-time notifications for likes, follows, and comments.
  Messaging: Direct messaging between users.
  Trends and Hashtags: Trending topics and hashtags feature.
  Analytics: User insights such as post reach, interactions, etc.

Non-Functional Requirements:

  Scalability: Ability to handle millions of users, posts, and interactions.
  Availability: Ensure minimal downtime and high availability.
  Consistency: Ensure real-time updates across the system.
  Low Latency: Deliver a seamless user experience.
  Security: User data protection, encryption, and prevention of spam or bot attacks.
  Resiliency: System should handle failures and auto-recover.

Capacity Estimate:
  Users: Assume 500 million active users.
  Posts per day: Assume each user posts twice per day. 1 billion posts/day.
  Storage: Each post averages 1KB (text) to 5MB (videos/images). Assume 70% text, 20% images, 10% videos.
  For text alone: 1 billion * 1KB = ~1TB/day.
  
  For multimedia (image/video): 300 million posts averaging 2MB => ~600TB/day.
  
  You would need distributed storage for text and media, optimized with a content delivery network (CDN) for multimedia content.
