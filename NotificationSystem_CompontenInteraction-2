Step-by-Step Flow:
1. Message Creation and Submission (NotificationProducer)
Client/System Interaction: A client (e.g., an e-commerce platform or backend service) triggers a notification, such as an order confirmation, password reset, or promotional message. This happens when an event occurs, like a successful order or an OTP request.
API Call: The client system sends an API request to the NotificationProducer. This request contains necessary details such as:
User details (email, phone, device token for push notifications)
Message type (Email, SMS, Push)
Priority level (e.g., high for OTP, low for marketing)
Message content (e.g., "Your order has been shipped.")

2. Message Queueing (Message Broker - Kafka)
Message Enqueue: The NotificationProducer validates the incoming request and produces a message to Kafka, a message queue. The message is sent to a specific Kafka topic based on its notification type or priority.
For example, email notifications might go to the "EmailTopic," SMS notifications to "SMSTopic," and push notifications to "PushTopic."
Kafka partitions the messages across different brokers based on the partitioning strategy (e.g., user ID).
Asynchronous Handling: Once the message is pushed to Kafka, the producer returns a success response to the client, and the message processing is done asynchronously.

3. Message Processing (NotificationHandler)
Consumer Setup: The NotificationHandler component is a consumer that listens to Kafka topics. There may be multiple handlers listening to different topics, such as one for email, one for SMS, and one for push notifications.
Kafka uses consumer groups to allow multiple handlers to process messages in parallel, improving scalability.
Message Handling: Once a message is consumed from Kafka:
The NotificationHandler checks user preferences to see if the user has opted in for the notification type (e.g., push notifications or SMS).
The message is enriched or transformed if needed, such as adding user-specific personalization or translating the message to the user’s preferred language.
Based on priority, high-priority messages are processed immediately, while low-priority messages may be delayed or rate-limited.

4. Third-Party Message Sender Integration
Email Gateway (e.g., SendGrid): If the message is an email, the NotificationHandler interacts with an external email provider like SendGrid, sends the email payload, and waits for confirmation.
SMS Gateway (e.g., Twilio): If it’s an SMS, the system uses an SMS provider like Twilio, sending the user’s phone number and message details.
Push Notification Provider (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging): For push notifications, the system interacts with FCM or Apple Push Notification Service (APNS), sending the device token and notification payload.
Error Handling: If the third-party service fails (e.g., the SMS gateway is down), the NotificationHandler retries based on a configured retry policy (e.g., exponential backoff) or sends the message to a Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) for manual investigation.

5. Message Delivery to User
The external service (e.g., Twilio, SendGrid, or FCM) delivers the message to the user’s device:
Email: The email is delivered to the user’s inbox.
SMS: The SMS is sent to the user’s phone.
Push Notification: The push notification appears on the user’s mobile device.

6. Delivery Confirmation and Status Updates
The third-party services send delivery status updates (e.g., delivered, failed, bounced) back to the NotificationHandler.
The NotificationHandler logs the status of the message delivery into a Notification Database (optional) for future auditing and analytics.
Deduplication: The system ensures no duplicate messages are sent by keeping track of previously sent notifications for a given event and user, thus avoiding redundancy.

7. Monitoring and Reporting
Real-Time Monitoring: Tools like Prometheus or Grafana monitor the entire notification system's health, tracking message queue size, third-party service availability, delivery success rates, etc.
Alerts: If there are significant delays in message delivery, high failure rates, or service outages, alerting systems notify engineers, ensuring timely resolution.
