High-Level Design (HLD) for Autocomplete Feature using TRIE
The high-level design (HLD) outlines the overall architecture, components, and flow of the autocomplete feature using the TRIE data structure. It includes the process for constructing the TRIE initially and handling autocomplete queries.

Components
Data Source: A database or a file containing the list of words to be used for autocomplete.
TRIE Construction Service: A service responsible for initializing and populating the TRIE with words from the data source.
TRIE Data Structure: The TRIE used to store words and support autocomplete queries.
Autocomplete Service: A service that interacts with the TRIE to add new words and fetch autocomplete suggestions.
API Controller: The entry point for client requests, invoking the Autocomplete Service to handle operations.
Client: The user interface or system making requests for autocomplete suggestions.

High-Level Flow

TRIE Initialization:

Load words from the data source.
Construct the TRIE by inserting each word.
The TRIE remains in memory for fast query responses.
Handling Autocomplete Queries:

Client sends a query with a prefix to the API Controller.
API Controller invokes the Autocomplete Service to get suggestions.
Autocomplete Service queries the TRIE for the prefix and retrieves matching words.
API Controller returns the suggestions to the client.
